# Node Red Home Automations
Here are the home automations I have configured for my HASSIO set up. 
If you are interested in inspecting my approach or can simply copy paste them feel free!
Saving on Github as a backup, but also to share with the home automation community.

# Automations

## Living Room

## Hallway

## Bedroom 1

## Bedroom 2

## Pantry

## Washroom


# How to Install
1. Open your node-red instance
2. In the burger drop-down click `import` and select the json file in this repo
3. DONE


# Disclaimers
1. These automations assume that you are using Zigbee2MQTT and Home Assistant
2. No credentials for MQTT or HASSIO are included, you'll need to configure these yourself
3. Some of the automations (like alarms) depend on custom made HASSIO helpers you'll need to rereate
