# Node Red Home Automations
After spending a year (on and off) honing in my DIY home automation system, I thought I'd share the Node-Red configs with the community. 
If you are interested in inspecting my approach or want to simply copy-paste them feel free!
Saving on Github as a backup, but also to share with the home automation community.

# How to Install
1. Open your node-red instance
2. In the burger drop-down click `import` and select the json file in this repo
3. DONE


# Disclaimers
1. These automations assume that you are using Zigbee2MQTT and Home Assistant
2. No credentials for MQTT or HASSIO are included, you'll need to configure these yourself
3. Some of the automations (like alarms) depend on custom made HASSIO helpers you'll need to rereate
